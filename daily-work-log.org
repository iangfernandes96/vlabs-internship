   + What is the task I was assigned today?  
     I was assigned the task of familiarizing myself with 
     the Emacs environment and IDE. I had to familiarize myself with the common
     commands used in Emacs and use those commands extensively while
     working with Emacs.

   + What did I get done against each task?
     I spent time familiarizing myself with most of the common
     commands, and used them repetitively, until I was able to use
     these commands with ease.
